# Wikipedia-Style IT Knowledge Repository

This repository is a structured, educational collection of IT-related content, written in a clear, accessible format. While it currently focuses on Linux networking topics, the goal is to gradually expand into other areas of system administration, infrastructure, and computer networking.

## Current Topics

- **Linux**
  - DHCP – Dynamic IP address assignment
  - DNS – Domain Name System configuration and usage
  - Monitoring – Tools and practices for network/system observation
  - VPN – Setting up and understanding virtual private networks
  - Web Server – Basics of web hosting and server configuration (e.g., Apache, Nginx)ű
  - File Sharing – Network-based file sharing solutions (e.g., Samba, NFS)
  - Development & Documentation – Tools and workflows to support sysadmin tasks and documentation best practices

## Purpose

The aim is to provide concise, wiki-style documentation that helps students, junior sysadmins, and curious learners understand and apply essential IT concepts through real-world examples and practical configurations.

## Future Expansion

As the project grows, expect new categories covering Windows, cloud technologies, cybersecurity, DevOps, IP networking, and more.
