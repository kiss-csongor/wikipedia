# IT Knowledge Wikipedia-Style Repository

This repository is a structured, educational collection of IT-related content, written in a clear, accessible format. While it currently focuses on Linux networking topics, the goal is to gradually expand into other areas of system administration, infrastructure, and computer networking.

## Current Topics

- **[Linux](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/Linux)**
  - [DHCP](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/Linux/DHCP) – Dynamic IP address assignment
  - [DNS](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/Linux/DNS) – Domain Name System configuration and usage
  - [Monitoring](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/Linux/Monitoring) – Tools and practices for network/system observation
  - [VPN](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/Linux/VPN) – Setting up and understanding virtual private networks
  - [Web Server](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/Linux/Web-Server) – Basics of web hosting and server configuration (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
  - [File Sharing](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/Linux/File-Sharing) – Network-based file sharing solutions (e.g., Samba, NFS)
  - [Development & Documentation](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/Linux/Development-&-Documentation) – Tools and workflows to support sysadmin tasks and documentation best practices

   - [Basic](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/IP-Networking/Basic) – Core concepts of IP networking, including addressing, subnetting, and foundational protocols
   - [Switch](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/IP-Networking/Switch) – Configuration and management of network switches for efficient data forwarding and network segmentation
   - [Router](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/IP-Networking/Router) – Setting up and maintaining routers to enable inter-network communication and proper traffic routing
     - [IPv4 Static Routing](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/IP-Networking/Router/IPv4-Static-Routing) – A guide on configuring static IPv4 routes to define fixed paths between networks, improving network efficiency and security.
     - [IPv6 Static Routing](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/IP-Networking/Router/IPv6-Static-Routing) – Instructions for setting up static IPv6 routes, allowing network traffic to flow correctly between IPv6-enabled devices.
     - [RIP Routing](https://github.com/kiss-csongor/wikipedia/tree/main/IP-Networking/Router/RIP-Routing) – Configuration of RIP (Routing Information Protocol), focusing on RIP v2, including setting up dynamic routing for simpler networks.

## Purpose

The aim is to provide concise, wiki-style documentation that helps students, junior sysadmins, and curious learners understand and apply essential IT concepts through real-world examples and practical configurations.

## Future Expansion

As the project grows, expect new categories covering Windows, cloud technologies, cybersecurity, DevOps, IP networking, and more.
